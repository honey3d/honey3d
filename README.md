# Honey Engine

This is a 3D game engine written in C. It is a personal project, so while *I* will probably
use it for some projects, I can't reccommend that others do the same unless you're ready
to really dig into the source code.

## Installation

The Honey engine requires

* OpenGL 3.3+
* GLFW3
* cglm
* assimp

To install:

```
cmake .
make
```
