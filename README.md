# Honey Engine

This is a 3D game engine written in C. It is a personal project, so while *I* will probably
use it for some projects, I can't reccommend that others do the same unless you're ready
to really dig into the source code.

The demo code, especially, is **very** rough. I'm using it as a testing ground for the features
I'm cramming in as fast as I can, so please be aware that it is almost certainly not written
with anything approaching good style.
